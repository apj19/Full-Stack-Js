callback

while running async code when we need do run dependet code based on previous result we call backs.
so using multiple callbacks it becomes unreadebale and hard to debug

solution:

Promise, async/await

promise chainig

promise-all--if all resolved if not then reject

promise.race-1st re or rej

promise.allsettled- return all including failed and fullfill

p.any first fullfill
